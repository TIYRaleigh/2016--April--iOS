# 00 -- This is Heavy

![BTTF](http://i.giphy.com/KL6leJilrOEVi.gif)

Most of this assignment is getting your laptop ready for Day 1 by installing a few key pieces of software and registering for certain invaluable services like Github and Slack. Beyond that, you'll start to get familiar with Github and basic source control concepts that we'll be using throughout the class. These aren't specific to any language or toolkit; they're universal developer skills.

## Requirements

You will notice in the __Tasks__ and __Requirements__ sections below that the text is a different font and style. It is displayed here without any formatting for easy copy/pasting by you. This checklist uses something called __Markdown__ and provides for really easy formatting. If you copy and paste the text _as is_ from the __Tasks__ and __Deliverables__ sections below into the __Description__ of your issue, you should end up with a bunch of checkboxes, thanks to [the way that Github interprets Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/). As you complete tasks, check off the corresponding checkboxes and let your progress bar fill up! Read [Mastering Issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/) for more information on creating issues in Github. For help creating your first issue, see below in the tasks list and also check out the exampe issue I created in the class repository on GitHub.

### Tasks:

* [X] [Create a Github account](https://github.com/signup)
* [X] Find and star [the class project](https://github.com/TIYRaleigh/2016--April--iOS)
* [ ] Read [the Home page on the class wiki](https://github.com/TIYRaleigh/2016--April--iOS/wiki)
* [ ] [Create a new _WIP Issue_](https://github.com/TIYRaleigh/2016--April--iOS/issues/new)
  * [ ] Named `00 -- This is Heavy -- YOUR NAME` (where `YOUR NAME` is _your_ name)
  * [ ] With this checklist as the description
* [ ] [Edit your Github profile](https://github.com/settings/profile) to provide:
  * [ ] A picture, so I can recognize your face.
  * [ ] Your full name, so I can recognize your name.
  * [ ] A valid public email address, so I can contact you if I need to.
* [ ] [Complete the "Hello World" Github guide](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/)
  * [ ] Add a link to your new Github repo as a comment on your *WIP Issue*
* [ ] Complete the Code School course [Try Git](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/try-git)
  * [ ] Take a screenshot of the Try Git course when you complete it and add it as a comment to your *WIP Issue*
* [ ] Create a new repository called `TIY-Assignments`
  * [ ] Check the box to create an initial `README.md` file
  * [ ] Select the `CC0` -- "Creative Commons" license for your work
  * [ ] Add a link to your `TIY-Assignments` repo as a comment on your *WIP Issue*
* [ ] Install Xcode from the Mac App Store. Simply search for _Xcode_.
* [ ] Open Xcode. Click the _Xcode_ menu in the menubar, then choose _Preferences_. Navigate to the _Downloads_ tab and install the latest iOS documentation (currently iOS 8.3, will probably be 9.0 when class starts). Once fully downloaded, the docset should have a small checkmark next to it.
* [ ] Watch _The Long Run_ Videos on [Delve.tv](http://delve.tv)
   * [ ] [_The Long Game_, part 1](http://delve.tv/the-long-game-part-one/)
   * [ ] [_The Long Game_, part 2](http://delve.tv/the-long-game-part-2/)
* [ ] Complete the [Swift Basics](http://teamtreehouse.com/library/swift-basics) course on Treehouse.
   * [ ] Take a screenshot of your points earned for the course and add it as a comment to your *WIP Issue*
* [ ] Look at the Prework-A file for instructions on how to complete the Counter app.
   * [ ] Your counter app files should be added to your TIY-Assignments repo. Because you previously added a link to your repo to your *WIP Issue*, I will be able to see your progress as you go. Be sure to commit/push the changes you make as you work on the app.
   * [ ] Read and complete the exercises for the [Command Line Crash Course](http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/book/). The command line is another name for the terminal. There are about 20 commands you'll use all the time on the command line, and it's helpful to have them memorized so we can use them right away.

## Extracurricular Activities

Regardless of how good you think you are at typing, a lot of the mistakes you make at first will be simple typographic errors. If you _don't_ know how to touch type (i.e. without looking at the keyboard), start practicing _now_ with [keybr.com](http://www.keybr.com/). If you're fairly confident in your typing ability, try working through the Objective-C lessons on [typing.io](http://typing.io).

If you've made it this far and are looking to get a leg up on the first few lectures, check out the following information from Apple's documentation on Swift:

* [ ] Check out the Swift Programming Language guide. Pay special attention to the first section [*Welcome To Swift*](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/GuidedTour.html).
   * [ ] From the Guided Tour section, read the paragraphs labelled, *Simple Values* and *Control Flow*.
   * [ ] Feel free to read the first few items under the section called, *The Basics*. This is in the *Language Guide* chapter.

Also note that this entire docset is available on iBooks as an electronic book. Feel free to download the iBook for your Mac or iOS device to use as reference during the class if you'd like.
